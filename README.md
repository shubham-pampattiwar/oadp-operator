# OADP Operator

## Overview

OADP is OpenShift Application Data Protection operator. This operator sets up and installs [Velero](https://velero.io/) on the OpenShift platform.

## Prerequisites

- Docker/Podman
- OpenShift CLI
- Access to OpenShift cluster

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

Checkout this OADP Operator repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:konveyor/oadp-operator.git
cd oadp-operator
```

### Building the Operator

Build the OADP operator image and push it to a public registry (quay.io or [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/))

There are two ways to build the operator image:

- Using operator-sdk
  ```
  operator-sdk build oadp-operator
  ```
- Using Podman/Docker
  ```
  podman build -f build/Dockerfile . -t oadp-operator:latest
  ```
After successfully building the operator image, push it to a public registry.

### Using the Image

In order to use the built image, please update the `operator.yaml` file. Replace the `REPLACE_IMAGE` place holder with with the image registry URL. You can edit the file manually or use the following command (Be sure to replace the `REGISTRY_URL` with your own registry URL):
```
sed -i 's|REPLACE_IMAGE|<REGISTRY_URL>|g' deploy/operator.yaml
```
For OSX, use the following command:
```
sed -i "" 's|REPLACE_IMAGE|<REGISTRY_URL>|g' deploy/operator.yaml
```

Before proceeding further make sure the `REPLACE_IMAGE` place holder is updated in the `operator.yaml` file as discussed above.

### Operator installation

To install OADP operator and the essential Velero components follow the steps given below:

- Create a new namespace named `oadp-operator`
  ```
  oc create namespace oadp-operator
  ```
- Switch to the `oadp-operator` namespace
  ```
  oc project oadp-operator
  ```
- Now to create the deployment, role, role binding, service account and the cluster role binding, use the following command:
  ```
  oc create -f deploy/
  ```
- Deploy the Velero custom resource definition:
  ```
  oc create -f deploy/crds/konveyor.openshift.io_veleros_crd.yaml   
  ```
- Finally, deploy the Velero CR:
  ```
  oc create -f deploy/crds/konveyor.openshift.io_v1alpha1_velero_cr.yaml
  ```

Post completion of all the above steps, you can check if the operator was successfully installed or not, the expected result for the command `oc get all -n oadp-operator` is as follows:
```

### Cleanup
For cleaning up the deployed resources, use the following commands:
```
oc delete -f deploy/crds/konveyor.openshift.io_v1alpha1_velero_cr.yaml
oc delete -f deploy/crds/konveyor.openshift.io_veleros_crd.yaml   
oc delete -f deploy/
oc delete namespace oadp-operator
oc delete crd $(oc get crds | grep velero.io | awk -F ' ' '{print $1}')
```
